 <h1 class = "summer">What Is Summer Ball</h2>









 <p class="summerparagraph">Football players spend their offseason lifting heavy weights (to build strength), running numerous sprints (to maintain endurance), and working tirelessly on skills and stick-work that'll be essential during games. Practices consist of specific position training as well as full-field scrimmages and large game play. </p>
