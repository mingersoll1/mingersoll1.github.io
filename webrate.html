<h1>Website Review</h1>
<h2><a href="https://www.dollartree.com">DollarTree</a></h2>
  <p>The Dollar Tree website is my worst website. First off the name of the store and website is misleading since everything is no longer a dollar so it should be called the 1.25 store. Next, there is too much to look at on the home page and you can scroll forever to get to the bottom. The Dollar Tree website wants to show you items to pick up on your next visit, yet they have had the same items for the past decade. You are also only allowed to only buy bulk items you cant buy one item. The HTML and code seem pretty modern and up to date yet the website still looks ghetto.

<h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a></h2>

  <p>I liked Amazon’s website. The lay out is nice and has lots of options and will push you to buy something. They have items that pop up after you have viewed them trying to get you to buy them which is a smart marketing tool. The colors go well together and work well with having pictures of items that are for sale. The footer has a ton of information and will point you to Amazon’s other websites and products. Amazon’s website had a ton of HTML that I didn’t understand so im gonna guess that it’s some modern stuff.

<h2><a href="https://www.chick-fil-a.com">Chick-Fil-A</a></h2>

  <p>The other website I liked was Chick-fil-A. It was very simple and modern. The colors really go well together and kinda make the pictures of the food pop out and look better. They also had a video of a spinning salad right when you open the website and I’ve never wanted to eat a salad this bad before. I really liked the layout of the website and it all tied back to the order food page which is good for sales. The HTML has HTML 5 elements. All and all this website made me hungry.
